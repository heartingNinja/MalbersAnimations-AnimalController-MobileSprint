# MalbersAnimations-AnimalController-MobileSprint
Unity Asset this is for: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/animation/animal-controller-148877
Haveing a sprint and jump button was a pain for good gameplay on mobile I felt, as it is really hard to have both be used at the same time. I wanted to sprint whenever I went to a max positon on the joystick. So I made this script.

Add script to the same gameobject that the Mobile Joystick is on. Set the Sprint Joy Stick to this gameobject. Add the Set Sprint to the Full Joy Stick Boolean and choose MEvent.Invoke.
